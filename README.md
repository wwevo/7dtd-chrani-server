# 7dtd-chrani-server

noob-coded python bot to control a 7 Days to Die game-server

this is only an experiment so far
so far it does
    connect to the games Telnet
    authenticating admin
    periodically polling 'lp' command (list_players)
    listening to chat for keywords
    ending script after set timeout or chat command

So even if this is not really useful at the moment, it might be a starting
point for noob coders like me :)
